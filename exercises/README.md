Challenges are tasks workshop students need to accomplish in order get a deeper understanding of workshop topic.
Solutions are description of how a one can solve a certain challenge. It is one way of how to do it and should only be revealed to the students after they had the opportunity to do it on their own.

And each solution in a corresponding solution folder:

e.g. 01-run-a-rails-app-solution
